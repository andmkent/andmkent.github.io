Update: (conditionally) accepted to [PLDI 2016](http://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2016).

A [draft paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07033) describing our
approach to extending Typed Racket with dependent refinement types and
arbitrary solver-backed theories is now available!

Looking forward to bringing these ideas to the Typed Racket to our
users at large.
