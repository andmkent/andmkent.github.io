Update: (conditionally) accepted to [PLDI 2016](http://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2016)!

A [preprint paper](http://conf.researchr.org/event/pldi-2016/pldi-2016-papers-occurrence-typing-modulo-theories) describing our
approach to extending Typed Racket with dependent refinement types and
arbitrary solver-backed theories is available!

I am looking forward to bringing these features to the Typed Racket user base.
