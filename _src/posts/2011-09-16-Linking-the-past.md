### Abstract

Historical social networks (HSNs) can be used to inform historical
research, including family history and genealogy. In some cases, clues
about the structure of an HSN can be found in artifacts of family
history such as personal diaries or autobiographical
sketches. However, manual inference of such networks can require
significant time and effort, including pooling and cross-referencing
many different data sources. We present our current research into
facilitating that process by automatically finding names in document
transcriptions, relating those names to the names found on a
roster/list of people who may be talked about in the documents, and
automatically generating a social network graph from the result. We
link individuals in the social network to a global genealogical
database so that people researching their own family histories can
easily find their ancestors within the HSNs created in this manner. We
also provide examples of how the linked HSNs may be used to inform
research about people and situations even when direct information is
scarce.
